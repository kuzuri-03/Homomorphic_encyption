# Homomorphic_encyption
This repository contains python program for homomorphic enryption.

Tasks :
Option 1. Cryptography
The problem will introduce you to the interesting concept of Homomorphic
Encryption which is a unique property of some of the crypto algorithms.
1. Read about Homomorphic Encryption (HE)
- Starting Point: https://blog.nucypher.com/an-engineers-guide-to-fully-
homomorphic-encryption/
2. Implement Encryption and Decryption functions in any HE/Partially HE
algorithm (Lattice-based preferred)
- Feel free to use existing libraries in Python/Golang
3. Demonstrate the additive and multiplicative property of the chosen algorithm
The evaluation criteria will be based on the approach you follow in tackling the
problem rather than the solution itself.
